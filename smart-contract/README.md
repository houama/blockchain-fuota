# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node -> to start hardhat network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost -> to deploy smart contract to localhost (hardhat network)
npx hardhat accounts -> to see list of all account/ address (dummy from hardhat framework)
npx hardhat compile -> to compile smart contract
npx hardhat help
```
